## üöÄ MCP Client Setup (VSCode + MCP CLI)

Set up the MCP client project and CLI environment locally:

```bash
# Skip to Create VSCode MCP Configuration section if you already have project setup.
# Initialize a new MCP client project
uv init your_mcp_client_project
cd your_mcp_client_project/

# Create a Python virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate


üõ†Ô∏è Create VSCode MCP Configuration
Create the required VSCode config file:

mkdir -p .vscode
touch .vscode/mcp.json
Then edit .vscode/mcp.json with the following content:

{
  "servers": {
    "mcp-http-stream-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/stream"
    }
}

This tells your VSCode MCP extension to connect to your locally running MCP server.

üê≥ Run the MCP Server via Docker
Each developer runs the MCP server locally in Docker. You don‚Äôt need to build the image yourself ‚Äî a prebuilt image is available via Cisco Container Registry.

Step 1: Authenticate with Cisco Container Registry
docker login containers.cisco.com
Step 2: Pull the MCP Docker Image
docker pull containers.cisco.com/zitun/mcp-jira-agent:jun_23_2025
Step 3: Run the MCP Server Locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 containers.cisco.com/zitun/mcp-jira-agent:jun_23_2025
The server will be available at http://localhost:8080.

üíª Using MCP in VSCode
Once the Docker container is running:

Open your project in VSCode (where .vscode/mcp.json exists).

The MCP extension will automatically connect to the local server at http://localhost:8080/mcp/stream.

You can now use the extension to:

Understand JIRA tickets

Generate implementation steps or code

Write unit tests

Create pull requests
